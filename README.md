# ghlookup-demo
A small demo on how to make REST-service calls with Angular.

Run `npm install` to install all packages. Start a web server at
the root of the repo (for instance, by `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or
similar)

Point your browser at `localhost:8000` or whatever you configured your
server to.
